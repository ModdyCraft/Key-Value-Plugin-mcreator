## Positive points

- Create lists that allow you to add values that you have to access with a key that you set which makes it much easier to find the desired value of a list.
- You can check if the list contains a certain value or the same does not happen with the keys, it can be used to make different mechanisms for your mods.
- You can remove a value by indicating its key, this means that when you delete a value the key will also be deleted.
- You can clean all the keys and their respective values whenever you want.

## Negative points

Not all the negative points have been found yet.

- An error occurs that also happens with a [Goldorion](https://github.com/Goldorion) plugin the plugin is [Array Lists](https://mcreator.net/plugin/65659/arraylists), it is not possible to use objects you type ItemStack, MCreator will always inform us of an error.
- Adding a value directly using a number without a semicolon will always return an integer to avoid this every time you add a value containing numbers uses a variable.
