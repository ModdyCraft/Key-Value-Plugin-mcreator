# Key Value Plugin mcreator
 
Plugin that allows you to add variables of type Map, which is something like an ArrayList but you can indicate a key to each value you add.
Now 100% compatible with blocks and objects, I still do not know if it is 100% bug free but it is fully functional so far.

## Positive points

- Create lists that allow you to add values that you have to access with a key that you set which makes it much easier to find the desired value of a list.
- You can check if the list contains a certain value or the same does not happen with the keys, it can be used to make different mechanisms for your mods.
- You can remove a value by indicating its key, this means that when you delete a value the key will also be deleted.
- You can clean all the keys and their respective values whenever you want.
- Now 100% compatible with blocks and objects, I still do not know if it is 100% bug free but it is fully functional so far.
